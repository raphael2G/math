# Math Repository

This repository contains collections of problems, theorems, inequalities, and proof strategies that I've studied and solved. Inside each category, the entries are organized by topic.

## 1. Problems

Here is a collection of math problems, categorized by topic. Each problem links to a detailed solution or analysis.

### Topic: Inequalities
- **[Geometric Median Problem](./Problems/GeometricMedian.md)**  
  Let $P_1, P_2, \dots, P_n$ be points on a line, not necessarily distinct. Which point(s) $P$ on the line minimize the sum of distances $\sum_{i=1}^{n} |P - P_i|$?

- **[Geometric Mean Problem](./Problems/GeometricMean.md)**  
  Minimize the sum of squared distances between points on a plane.

## 2. Theorems

A collection of theorems with a brief description of their key insights. Click the links to view the full theorem and proof.

### Topic: Inequalities
- **[Triangle Inequality](./Theorems/TriangleInequality.md)**  
  States that $|x + y| \leq |x| + |y|$ for real numbers $x$ and $y$.

## 3. Proof Strategies

Common proof strategies, with a brief description of when they are used. Click the links to see examples of their use in problems.

### Topic: Inequalities
- **[Induction](./ProofStrategies/Induction.md)**  
  Use when proving statements involving natural numbers.

- **[Contradiction](./ProofStrategies/Contradiction.md)**  
  Assume the opposite of what you want to prove and show a contradiction arises.

- **[Pigeonhole Principle](./ProofStrategies/PigeonholePrinciple.md)**  
  Useful in combinatorics problems to show that if you put more items into fewer containers, one container must hold more than one item.
