# Math Repository

This repository contains collections of problems, theorems, inequalities, and proof strategies that I've studied and solved. Inside each category, the entries are organized by topic.

## 1. Problems

Here is a collection of math problems, categorized by topic. Each problem links to a detailed solution or analysis.

### Topic: Inequalities
  - **[Geometric Median Problem](./Problems/GeometricMedian.md)**  
  Let $P_1, P_2, \dots, P_n$ be points on a line, not necessarily distinct. Which point(s) $P$ on the line minimize the sum of distances $\sum_{i=1}^{n} |P - P_i|$?

- **[Geometric Mean Problem](./Problems/GeometricMean.md)**  
  Minimize the sum of squared distances between points on a plane.

- **[AM-HM Inequality](./Problems/AmHmInequality.md)**  
Solve a problem using the AM-HM inequality

- **[Exponential Inequality Comparison](./Problems/ExponentialInequalityComparison.md)**  
  Given $n > 8$, compare $a^b$ and $b^a$ for $a = \sqrt{n}$ and $b = \sqrt{n+1}$.


### Topic: Convergence

  - **[Basic Convergence Problem](./Problems/Convergence/ConvergentSum.md)**
  Given $\sum^{\infin}_{i=1}a_i^2$ and $\sum^{\infin}_{i=1}b_i^2$ both converge, show $\sum^{\infin}_{i=1}a_ib_i$ converges

  - **[Showing the Maximum Growth Rate of Convergent Sums](./Problems/Convergence/ConvergetSumsMaxGrowthRate.md)**  
  Given $a_1, a_2, \dots$ are positive integers such that $\sum \frac{1}{a_i}$ converges, prove that $\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{b_n}{n} = 0$ where $b_n$ denotes the number of $i$ such that $a_i \leq n$.

  - **[Convergence of Spaced Complex Sums](./Problems/Convergence/ConvergenceOfSpacedComplexSum.md)**  
Let $z_1, z_2, z_3, \ldots$ be non-zero complex numbers with the property that $|z_i - z_j| > 1 \ \forall i, j$. Prove that: $\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{z_i^3}$ converges.
