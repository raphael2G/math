# Math Repository

This repository contains collections of problems, theorems, inequalities, and proof strategies that I've studied and solved. Inside each category, the entries are organized by topic.

## 1. Problems

Here is a collection of math problems, categorized by topic. Each problem links to a detailed solution or analysis.

### Topic: Inequalities
- **[Geometric Median Problem](./Problems/GeometricMedian.md)**  
  Let $P_1, P_2, \dots, P_n$ be points on a line, not necessarily distinct. Which point(s) $P$ on the line minimize the sum of distances $\sum_{i=1}^{n} |P - P_i|$?

- **[Geometric Mean Problem](./Problems/GeometricMean.md)**  
  Minimize the sum of squared distances between points on a plane.

- **[AM-HM Inequality](./Problems/AmHmInequality.md)**  
Solve a problem using the AM-HM inequality

- **[Exponential Inequality Comparison](./Problems/ExponentialInequalityComparison.md)**  
  Given $n > 8$, compare $a^b$ and $b^a$ for $a = \sqrt{n}$ and $b = \sqrt{n+1}$.

### Topic: Inequalities
### Topic: Inequalities
- **[Triangle Inequality](./Theorems/TriangleInequality.md)**  
  States that $|x + y| \leq |x| + |y|$ for real numbers $x$ and $y$.

- **[QM-AM-GM-HM Inequality](./Theorems/QM-AM-GM-HM.md)**  
  Describes the chain of inequalities between the quadratic mean, arithmetic mean, geometric mean, and harmonic mean.



## 3. Proof Strategies

Common proof strategies, with a brief description of when they are used. Click the links to see examples of their use in problems.


- **[Monotonicity of Functions](./Theorems/MonotonicityOfFunctions.md)**  
  Describes the general conditions under which a function is increasing or decreasing, using derivative analysis.

- **[Findng Extremas of Functions](./ProofStrategies/FindingMinimumsOfFunctions.md)**  
  Describes the general conditions under which a function is increasing or decreasing, using derivative analysis.
