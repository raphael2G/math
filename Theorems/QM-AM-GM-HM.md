# Theorem: QM-AM-GM-HM Inequality

The **Quadratic Mean (QM)**, **Arithmetic Mean (AM)**, **Geometric Mean (GM)**, and **Harmonic Mean (HM)** inequality is a chain of inequalities that relates the means of a set of non-negative real numbers.

### Statement:

For any set of non-negative real numbers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$, the following inequalities hold:

$$
\text{QM} \geq \text{AM} \geq \text{GM} \geq \text{HM}
$$

Specifically, the inequalities are defined as:

1. **Quadratic Mean (QM):**

   The quadratic mean of the numbers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ is:

   $$
   \text{QM} = \sqrt{\frac{a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \dots + a_n^2}{n}}
   $$

2. **Arithmetic Mean (AM):**

   The arithmetic mean of the numbers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ is:

   $$
   \text{AM} = \frac{a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_n}{n}
   $$

3. **Geometric Mean (GM):**

   The geometric mean of the numbers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ is:

   $$
   \text{GM} = \sqrt[n]{a_1 \cdot a_2 \cdot \dots \cdot a_n}
   $$

4. **Harmonic Mean (HM):**

   The harmonic mean of the numbers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ is:

   $$
   \text{HM} = \frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_1} + \frac{1}{a_2} + \dots + \frac{1}{a_n}}
   $$

### Applications:

- The QM-AM-GM-HM inequality is commonly used in mathematical analysis, optimization, and inequalities.
- It shows that the quadratic mean is always the largest and the harmonic mean is always the smallest of the four.
- The inequality is particularly useful in proving bounds and other inequalities.

### Examples:

- **Simple Case ($n = 2$):**  
  For two numbers $a$ and $b$, the inequality is:

  $$
  \sqrt{\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}} \geq \frac{a + b}{2} \geq \sqrt{ab} \geq \frac{2}{\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b}}
  $$
